								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Life is like a roller coaster- full of ups and full of downs. Going up is full of excitement and anticipation, but going down can be scary and daunting. Being able to navigate the ups and downs of life can sometimes be difficult and all you ask is to be able to take back the reigns and control the crazy ride that is life. My office provides a warm, welcoming environment full of acceptance and compassion to help guide you through life's lows and get back to those high's, better than ever before. Together we will settle anxieties, ease pains, settle doubts while raising hopes and bringing dreams to life.
									I use a strength's based and client centered approach with every client, along with compassion and empathy. Working with a diverse population, I utilize a wide range of treatment modalities to ensure that each client is getting the treatment that best fits their needs. My goal is to help you address your needs and be able to take back the reigns of life.</p>
								<p>Life can present us with many challenges and facing those with a helping hand can give you the strength you need to seize each day. I will be there for you every step of the way- offering support during times of struggle, finding joy in daily life, and finding strength to take on everything to come. My focus is you and helping you reach your goals.</p>

									<h1>Chloe<br />
									 Heberlein</h1>
									<p>Counselor, MA, tLMHC</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Life so often gets set on autopilot, catching us off guard only when the oxygen masks drop from the ceiling of the plane. In order to course correct, your oxygen mask needs to be put on. That’s where I step in. When meeting with me, I will treat you with authenticity, validating the feelings you are having, listening to what you are saying, reinforcing the skills you already have, all the while shooting you straight with direct compassion.</p>
								<p>People are so quick to brush off any hard feeling, leaving you feeling so invalidated. I want you to know that it is okay to not be okay. Let’s take some time to work through where others have left you feeling less than, admiring how far you have come, and working toward a future where course correction happens before oxygen masks drop down.
									My goal is to take what you bring to the session, sift through the debris, reconstruct what works well, and build up the pieces that need added strength. Meeting with me means you will be heard, you will be understood, and you will keep from crashing.</p>

									<h1>Josh<br />
									 Bird</h1>
									<p>Counselor,  MA, tLMHC</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>is a counselor in Dubuque, Iowa. Josh specializes in Play Therapy based modalities, Adlerian modalities, and uses a combination of evidence based techniques from Cognitive Behavioral, Mindfulness, and Dialectical Behavioral therapies. As Josh fully believes the culture of children lies in “play,” Josh addresses play as a valuable tool when working with younger clients, identifying the language and themes client playstyles provide. As play is preferential for younger clients, ages 4-8, Josh recognizes the importance of more reflective modalities working with older children and adolescents.</p>
								<p> As a counselor, Josh’s main goal is to assist his clients along their own individualized journeys to enhanced well-being, and empower clients through gaining insight into their own personhood and realizing untapped potential to positively alter both their own lifes, and lives or others.</p>
