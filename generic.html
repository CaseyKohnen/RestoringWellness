								<p>Hey! I’m Riley, owner of and therapist with Restoring Wellness. Restoring Wellness was created at a point in my life when I needed more for myself and my family. As the mama of two young kiddos, who is also coping with life’s transitions, I’ve made it my mission to help mamas thrive throughout their pregnancy and postpartum phase(s) of life, ensuring a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle for years to come.</p>
								<p>After working with kids for most of my career, I had my “ahh ha” moment during my first maternity leave. I thought, “if I can help mamas manage their mental health and wellbeing, I can prevent kiddos from ever needing to come to see me.” So, with that thought, I became fully trained to work with perinatal mental health through Postpartum Support International.</p>
								<p>Being a mama is hard. Being a mama who raises emotionally intelligent kids can feel impossible. I will guide you to be at your best so that you can raise your baby/babies to be their strongest selves. It is always an honor to work with a mama who recognizes the importance of filling their cup, to be able to fill the cup of their little(s). You can reach me at </p>

								<p>Life so often gets set on autopilot, catching us off guard only when the oxygen masks drop from the ceiling of the plane. In order to course correct, your oxygen mask needs to be put on. That’s where I step in. When meeting with me, I will treat you with authenticity, validating the feelings you are having, listening to what you are saying, reinforcing the skills you already have, all the while shooting you straight with direct compassion.</p>
								<p>People are so quick to brush off any hard feeling, leaving you feeling so invalidated. I want you to know that it is okay to not be okay. Let’s take some time to work through where others have left you feeling less than, admiring how far you have come, and working toward a future where course correction happens before oxygen masks drop down.
									My goal is to take what you bring to the session, sift through the debris, reconstruct what works well, and build up the pieces that need added strength. Meeting with me means you will be heard, you will be understood, and you will keep from crashing.</p>

								<!--<p>Life is like a roller coaster- full of ups and full of downs. Going up is full of excitement and anticipation, but going down can be scary and daunting. Being able to navigate the ups and downs of life can sometimes be difficult and all you ask is to be able to take back the reigns and control the crazy ride that is life. My office provides a warm, welcoming environment full of acceptance and compassion to help guide you through life's lows and get back to those high's, better than ever before. Together we will settle anxieties, ease pains, settle doubts while raising hopes and bringing dreams to life.
									I use a strength's based and client centered approach with every client, along with compassion and empathy. Working with a diverse population, I utilize a wide range of treatment modalities to ensure that each client is getting the treatment that best fits their needs. My goal is to help you address your needs and be able to take back the reigns of life.</p>
								<p>Life can present us with many challenges and facing those with a helping hand can give you the strength you need to seize each day. I will be there for you every step of the way- offering support during times of struggle, finding joy in daily life, and finding strength to take on everything to come. My focus is you and helping you reach your goals.</p>-->
								<p>Do you find yourself staring at the mirror comparing yourself to others, questioning the decisions you’re making, and experiencing fearful thinking about how to make change or the idea of change itself? Your world is full of chaos that whirls more out of control each day, the more you try to hold on the more difficult it seems to keep your grip. Like your body isn’t able to support or keep up with you- creating fear, anxiety, and other feelings you can’t even begin to describe. Like the mirror in front of you is cracking in a million directions and you don’t know how to fix the image of the person standing in front of you.</p>
								<p>You deserve to look in the mirror and feel good about your appearance and who you are as a person. You should be able to relax away racing thoughts of stress, guilt, and fear; replacing those thoughts with valuable time with your supports, genuine pleasure in your hobbies, and no fear about the next day, next challenge, or the next person’s opinion.</p>
								<p>Beginning therapy can feel daunting, but it can also be the start to the light at the end of the tunnel. When you’re ready to leave your doubts, stress, and fear behind, give me a call and I’ll get you scheduled for the first session and on the way to a happier, less stressful life that you get to be the one in control of.</p>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Josh Mini Bio.jpg" alt="Josh's Picture" /></div>
								<p>is a counselor in Dubuque, Iowa. Josh specializes in Play Therapy based modalities, Adlerian modalities, and uses a combination of evidence based techniques from Cognitive Behavioral, Mindfulness, and Dialectical Behavioral therapies. As Josh fully believes the culture of children lies in “play,” Josh addresses play as a valuable tool when working with younger clients, identifying the language and themes client playstyles provide. As play is preferential for younger clients, ages 4-8, Josh recognizes the importance of more reflective modalities working with older children and adolescents.</p>
								<p> As a counselor, Josh’s main goal is to assist his clients along their own individualized journeys to enhanced well-being, and empower clients through gaining insight into their own personhood and realizing untapped potential to positively alter both their own lifes, and lives or others.</p>
