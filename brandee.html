								<!--<p>Life is like a roller coaster- full of ups and full of downs. Going up is full of excitement and anticipation, but going down can be scary and daunting. Being able to navigate the ups and downs of life can sometimes be difficult and all you ask is to be able to take back the reigns and control the crazy ride that is life. My office provides a warm, welcoming environment full of acceptance and compassion to help guide you through life's lows and get back to those high's, better than ever before. Together we will settle anxieties, ease pains, settle doubts while raising hopes and bringing dreams to life.
									I use a strength's based and client centered approach with every client, along with compassion and empathy. Working with a diverse population, I utilize a wide range of treatment modalities to ensure that each client is getting the treatment that best fits their needs. My goal is to help you address your needs and be able to take back the reigns of life.</p>
								<p>Life can present us with many challenges and facing those with a helping hand can give you the strength you need to seize each day. I will be there for you every step of the way- offering support during times of struggle, finding joy in daily life, and finding strength to take on everything to come. My focus is you and helping you reach your goals.</p>-->
								<p>Do you find yourself staring at the mirror comparing yourself to others, questioning the decisions you’re making, and experiencing fearful thinking about how to make change or the idea of change itself? Your world is full of chaos that whirls more out of control each day, the more you try to hold on the more difficult it seems to keep your grip. Like your body isn’t able to support or keep up with you- creating fear, anxiety, and other feelings you can’t even begin to describe. Like the mirror in front of you is cracking in a million directions and you don’t know how to fix the image of the person standing in front of you.</p>
								<p>You deserve to look in the mirror and feel good about your appearance and who you are as a person. You should be able to relax away racing thoughts of stress, guilt, and fear; replacing those thoughts with valuable time with your supports, genuine pleasure in your hobbies, and no fear about the next day, next challenge, or the next person’s opinion.</p>
								<p>Beginning therapy can feel daunting, but it can also be the start to the light at the end of the tunnel. When you’re ready to leave your doubts, stress, and fear behind, give me a call and I’ll get you scheduled for the first session and on the way to a happier, less stressful life that you get to be the one in control of.</p>
